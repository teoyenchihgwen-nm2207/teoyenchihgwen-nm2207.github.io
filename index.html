                    <p> In 2022, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/">Pew Research Center's analysis</a>  of median hourly earnings of both full- and part-time workers, 
                        women earned an average of 82% of what men earned. Despite the progress that women have made over the years, the gender wage gap has remained a persistent inequity in the United States
                        over the past 20 years, increasing only by 2% since 2000. The consequences of this gap affects women throughout their lives. </p>
                    <p> There are a multitude of  factors that contribute to the disparity in wages between men and women: age, educational attainment, race,
                        presence of children and the types of jobs that men and women segregate to. The unmeasurable or unquanitfiable part of the gender pay gap
                        is often said to be a result of gender discrimination.

                Observing the median income of men and women based on 2020 averages (Table P-2), 
                we provide a general view of the disparities in incomes between the genders. 
                We observe that men reportedly have a higher median income than women and this gap 
                between men and women’s income have remained relatively the same over the past 
                20 years (2000 - 2021). </div>
                

            <div id="edutext" style="text-align:left; display: none;"> 
                Educational attainment is an important factor that affects an individual’s wage. 
                Studies have consistently shown that higher levels of education are associated with higher earnings, 
                and this is true for both men and women.
                <br>
                <br>
                Women have made leaps and bounds in educational progress, yet we still observe that 
                women earn significantly less than men. In the graph above, we compare the median income 
                of men and women who have attained Bachelor Degrees or higher (Table P-16). 
                Although women with higher education earn more compared to the average population of 
                women, women’s earnings are still trailing those of men. Although gains in education have 
                raised the average earnings of women and have narrowed the gender pay gap overall, 
                college-educated women are no closer to wage parity with their male counterparts than

            Addressing the intersection of race and gender is critical for reducing the wage gap. 
            Studies have consistently shown that women of color face a persistently larger wage gap 
            compared to white women. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The chart above features Women's Earnings as a Percentage of Men's Earnings by Race
                and Hispanic Origin from 2010 to 2021. (Table P-40). Surprisingly, our findings contradict 
                popular literature that Black and Hispanic women of color are likely to have larger wage 
                gaps. Instead, the dataset show that Black and Hispanic women’s earnings as a percentage of 
                men’s continue to be the highest for this period of time, while Asian and white women’s 
                earnings are lower in comparison. The data presented in the chart challenges stereotypes 
                and emphasizes the need for a more nuanced understanding of the gender wage gap.

            <p class="mb-5 pb-4" style="text-align: left;"> 
                Occupational segregation, or the concentration of men and women in different occupations and industries,
                is a key factor contributing to the gender wage gap. Occupational segregation is defined as the phenomenon where one demographic group is overrepresented or underrepresented in a certain job category <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/occupational-segregation-in-america/#:~:text=In%20predominantly%20female%20roles%2C%20occupational,genders%2C%20races%2C%20and%20ethnicities.&text=Highly%20gender%2Dsegregated%20labor%20markets,the%20earnings%20of%20Black%20women.">
                (Occupational Segregation in America, 2023)</a>.
                Women are still highly concentrated in relatively few, predominately female occupations with lower pay.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                Occupational segregation has a direct impact on the gender wage gap because it limits 
                women's opportunities for higher earnings and career advancement. When women are concentrated 
                in lower-paying jobs, they are less likely to earn salaries comparable to men in higher-paying
                 jobs. This limits women's opportunities for advancement and professional development, which can further exacerbate the wage gap.

                The data from the above charts are derrived from Table 2 of <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2020/home.htm"> CPS women's earnings data from US Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS)</a> in 2020. 
                Horizontal segregation occurs when women are concentrated in lower paying occupations/fields with worse working 
                conditions and fewer chances for advancement. It can be observed that women are overrepresented in fields such as education (73%), healthcare (74%), 
                and administrative occupations (72%), as seen by the overwhelming proportion of women compared to men in these sectors. 
                Men overwhelmingly tend to fall into manual (95%) fields.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, vertical segregation occurs when women are concentrated in lower level, lower paying roles 
                in the same occupations/field. For instance, within the healthcare sector, 
                women are more likely to work in lower-paying positions such as nursing and 
                support staff, while men are more likely to hold higher-paying positions such as 
                physicians and executives. 
                <br>
                <br>
                On a positive note, we can observe that within professional occupations, there is a larger proportion of females (55%) 
                than males (45%). This occupational category is made up of several distinct job groupings for 
                specialized fields, such as computer science and math, architecture and engineering, 
                law, education, and healthcare. As mentioned by Autor & Wasserman in their book, “Wayward Sons”, 
                men’s position in the labour market is deteriorating due to skill-based 
                technological change. The authors suggest that technology and women's skills are viewed as complementary, 
                whereas technology and men's skills are viewed as substitutes. This has led to women upskilling while 
                men are downskilling, which in turn has contributed to a higher representation of women in 
                professional occupations.

        <p class="mb-5 pb-4" style="text-align:left;"> 
            The motherhood penalty is another factor that contributes to the gender wage gap. 
            Estimates suggest that motherhood may account for much of the current shortfall 
            in the earnings potential of women overall. Women who take breaks in their careers to care for their children, 
            sacrifice a portion of their earnings. This penalty is greater for mothers compared to fathers.
            <br>
            <br>
            This phenomenon can be credited to employers assuming that mothers are less
            committed to their jobs or less productive than their childless counterparts, even if this assumption
            is unfounded. Additionally, women with children may face additional responsibilities and constraints
            that make it difficult to balance work and family, such as caregiving duties and limited access to
            affordable childcare.
            <br>
            <br>
            The motherhood penalty can have long-term consequences for women's earnings and career trajectories. 
            Women who take time off or work reduced hours to care for their children may miss out on opportunities
            for advancement and professional development, which can limit their earning potential over time. 
            Additionally, the motherhood penalty can contribute to gender disparities in retirement savings and 
            social security benefits, which can have significant implications for women's financial security in later 
            life.

                rotation group files (IPUMS)</a>, the effect of motherhood is most significant amongst women aged 25 to 34 years as this is 
                the age group that they are most likely to have children. In 2022, mothers aged 25 to 34 earned 85% as much as fathers that age, while women without children in the same 
                age group, earned 97% as much as fathers. Women aged 35-44 earned roughly the same (80%), with and without children.

                    <p> The gender wage gap is a complex issue that is influenced by many factors, 
                        including occupational segregation and the motherhood penalty. Both occupational segregation
                        and motherhood penalty are rooted in gender discrimination and stereotypes that dictates and decides 
                        what a women's role in society should be. These factors interact in complex ways to create disparities
                        in earnings and opportunities between men and women, which can have significant implications for 
                        women's financial security and well-being.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        To address the gender wage gap and promote greater equity, greater efforts in education are needed to 
                        address these biases and stereotypes. Policies and programs are needed to support working parents, including paid parental leave, affordable childcare, and flexible work 
                        arrangements. By addressing these factors, we can help to create a more just and equitable society for all.
